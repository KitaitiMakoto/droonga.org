## Abstract {#abstract}

A collector merges two input values to a result.
The Droonga Engine tries to collect three or more values by applying the specified collector again and again.

## Built-in collector classes {#builtin-collectors}

There are some pre-defined collector classes used by built-in plugins.
Of course they are avialable for your custom plugins.

### `Droonga::Collectors::And`

### `Droonga::Collectors::Or`

### `Droonga::Collectors::Sum`

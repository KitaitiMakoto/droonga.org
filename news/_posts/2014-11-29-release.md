## What's Droonga?

Droonga is a distributed full text search engine, compatible to [Groonga][groonga].
A Droonga cluster works like an HTTP server compatible to [Groonga][groonga] with the replication feature.

Are you interested in Droonga: how it works and how useful?
Let's try the [tutorial][] for an introduction, and see the [overview][] to understand Droonga's design strategy more and more.

## Improvements in Droonga 1.0.8

This release Droonga 1.0.8 contains many improvements.
Major topics are here:

### Orchestration of front-end HTTP server nodes

A front-end HTTP server node based on `droonga-http-server` has become to a member of the Droonga cluster truly.

In old versions, a `droonga-http-server` node was strongly bound to a `droonga-engine` node.
So, if a `droonga-engine` node died, `droonga-http-server` nodes associated to the `droonga-engine` node also died.

But now, the limitation has been gone.
Even if one of `droonga-engine` node become unavailable, `droonga-http-server` nodes keep them working with active `droonga-engine` nodes automatically.
Moreover, a `droonga-http-server` node distributes requests from clients to multiple `droonga-engine` nodes.
In other words, now it works like a simple load balancer.

### Better performance for search operations, especially with `groupBy` (Groonga's `select` with drilldown options)

The performance issue around `groupBy` is solved for replicas with single slices.
Moreover, search operations with `offset` option also optimized.

Benchmark results (comparisons with Groonga) are here:

Conditions:

 * There are 1500000 records from Wikipedia (Japanese)
 * All requests are full-text search queries for actual page titles, with drilldown, like:
   `/d/select?command_version=2&table=Pages&limit=10&match_columns=title,text&output_columns=snippet_html(title),snippet_html(text),categories,_key&query_flags=NONE&sortby=title&drilldown=categories&drilldown_limit=10&drilldown_output_columns=_id,_key,_nsubrecs&drilldown_sortby=_nsubrecs&query=Wikipedia%3AText+of+GNU+Free+Documentation+License`
 * Supposed cache hit rate is 50%.
 * Measured on physical PCs for development.
   * node0: Ubuntu 14.04LTS, Intel Core i5 M460 2.53GHz, 8GB RAM
   * node1: Ubuntu 14.04LTS, Intel Core i5 650 3.20GHz, 6GB RAM
   * node2: Ubuntu 14.04LTS, Intel Core i5 650 3.20GHz, 8GB RAM
   * client: Ubuntu 14.04LTS, Intel Core i5-4300U vPro 1.90GHz, 4GB RAM

Detailed results are [downloadable](https://github.com/droonga/presentation-groonga-night-5-droonga-as-groonga-with-replication/tree/master/benchmark).

As above, currently throughput performance of single Droonga node is comparable to Groonga.
Moreover, throughput limit can be extended by adding more Droonga nodes to the cluster.

On the other hand, there is a little latency basically on Droonga.
However, large number accesses turn the advantage around the upper limit of Groonga.
If there are too many requests, Droonga can respond quickly than Groonga.

### Better compatibility to Groonga

Some minor incompatibilities have been corrected.

 * `select` command:
   * The `output_columns` option accepts whitespace-separated list of column names (compatible to Groonga's `command_version=1` form.)
   * `output_columns=*` works correctly for `TABLE_NO_KEY` tables.
 * `column_list` command:
   * A `_key` virtual column is correctly appear in the result, for tables with one of flags: `TABLE_HASH_KEY`, `TABLE_PAT_KEY`, and `TABLE_DAT_KEY`.
   * At an index column, its `source` is now compatible to Groonga's one.
 * `table_create` command:
   * The `key_type` parameter becomes required for `TABLE_HASH_KEY`, `TABLE_PAT_KEY`, and `TABLE_DAT_KEY` tables.
     You'll get an error response, if the parameter is not given.
     (Groonga unexpectedly accepts `table_create` requests without `key_type` parameter, but it is a known issue.)

### Detailed list of all improvements

 * [Droonga-engine][droonga-engine] 1.0.8
   * Better compatibility to Groonga's `select`, `column_list`, and `table_create` commands.
     (See above)
   * The `daemon` option is now ignored in the static configuration file.
     Now, you always have to specify `--daemon` option for the `droonga-engine` command
     to start it as a daemon.
   * The `droonga-engine-configure` command now shows prompts for all options always.
   * The rate of absorbed records are limited to 100 records per second by default, for `droonga-engine-absorb-data` and `droonga-engine-join` commands.
   * `droonga-engine-absorb-data` and `droonga-engine-join` commands now report their progress, if possible.
 * [Droonga-http-server][droonga-http-server] 1.0.9
   * A new `--host` option is available to restrict the listening IP address.
     The default value is `0.0.0.0` (meaning `listen all IP addresses`).
   * A new `--cache-ttl-in-seconds` option is available to set the time to live of cached responses, in seconds.
     The default value is `60` (meaning `1 minute`).
   * A new `--disable-trust-proxy` option is available to disable the feature
     even if it is activated by the static configuration file.
   * A new `--document-root` option is available to specify the document root.
     It is the path to the built-in Groonga admin page by default.
   * The `daemon` option is now ignored in the static configuration file.
     Now, you always have to specify `--daemon` option for the `droonga-http-server` command
     to start it as a daemon.
   * The `droonga-http-server-configure` command now shows prompts for all options always.
   * Responses for most commands are never cached.
     Now, only responses based on `search` or Groonga's `select` commands and the administration page are cached.
   * A new endopoint `/cache` is introduced to clear all response caches.
     To clear cached contents, send an HTTP `DELETE` request to the path.
   * Improvements from `express-droonga` itself.
     (See below)
 * [Express-droonga][express-droonga] 1.0.7
   * Supports multiple Droonga Engine nodes as its backends.
     Now `express-droonga` can work like a load balancer.
   * The list of connecting Droonga Engine nodes can be automatically updated
     based on the actual list of active members in the cluster.
     This feature is activated by the `syncHostNames` option for the `application.droonga()` method.
 * [Drnbench][drnbench] 1.0.4
   * `drnbench-request-response`
     * Not only top slow requests, but top fast requests are also reported.
       It will help you to detect "strange good" results from invalid queries or something.
       The number of reported fast requests can be customized via the new `--n-fast-requests` option.
     * Virtual clients are working with multiple processes.
       If there are multiple processors in your computer, drnbench uses them more effectively.
 * [Drntest][drntest] 1.1.7 (released at 2014-11-18)
   * Accept virtual column like `_key` as a part of Groonga's `column_list` command response.

## Conclusion

 * Droonga 1.0.8 has been released!
 * Front-end HTTP server nodes are now orchestrated as nodes in the cluster.
   Droonga clusters now work more robustly.
 * The throughput performance is comparable to / better than Groonga now.
 * It becomes more compatible to Groonga.
 * Droonga project will release a new version every month!

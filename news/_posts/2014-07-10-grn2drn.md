Today, we've released [grn2drn 1.0.3][grn2drn].

On this version, `grn2drn`'s `--dataset` parameter became optional. If you omit the option, `Default` is used as the dataset.

And, now a new `--encoding` option is available for `grn2drn`. It will help you if you created Groonga's database with non-UTF-8 encoding (Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, etc.)

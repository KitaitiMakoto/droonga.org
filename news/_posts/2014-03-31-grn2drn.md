At the day 2014-03-29, we released [grn2drn 1.0.1][grn2drn] also.
We forgot to write this topic in the list of updated topics...

The project grn2drn provides some command line tools to use Groonga's command lists for Droonga.
For example, you can generate a JSONs file from Groonga's `load` command line.

In this release, we added a new command `grn2drn-schema` which converts any Groonga's command list to the "schema" part of the `catalog.json`.
It will help you to write your custom `catalog.json` by hand, if you know how to define Groonga's tables.

## About Droonga

Droonga is a scalable data processing engine. Droonga uses stream oriented processing model. Droonga processes data by pipeline. Many operations such as search, update, group are done in pipeline.

## About this release

The current Droonga version is 0.8.0. This is the first stable release.

The release has the following improvements:

 * [search][]: Supported [groupBy][] with multiple partitions.
 * Supported some error responses.
 * Improved plugin API. Plugin API documentation will be published in the next release.
 * Added micro seconds information to time value. It uses [W3C-DTF][] format such as `2013-12-29T00:00:00.000000Z`.
 * [catalog][]: Added [version][] to improve backward compatibility.
 * Changed the name of adapter plugin that provides Groonga's [select][] compatible API to `groonga` from `select`. The `groonga` adapter will provide more Groonga compatible commands.
 * Changed plugin path format:

   Old:

       droonga/plugin/#{PLUGIN_TYPE}/#{PLUGIN_NAME}.rb

   New:

       droonga/plugin/#{PLUGIN_TYPE}_#{PLUGIN_NAME}.rb

   We use a directory per plugin type instead of putting all plugins to `droonga/plugin/` directory. Because it is more maintainable.
 * Split adapter plugin into input adapter plugin and output adapter plugin. You can in the next release.
 * Added documentations in English.

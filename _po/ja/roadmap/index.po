" * Optimize performance of `search` for unsharded replicas.\n"
"   (Currently, mechanisms of hash-based sharding always affect for replicas.\n"
"   They should be skipped for unsharded replicas.)\n"
" * Support hash-based sharding of replicas, by `droonga-enigine-join` and `dro"
"onga-engine-unjoin` commands.\n"
" * Support non-stop modification of cluster structure.\n"
"   (Currently, we have to stop updating data while modifying cluster structure"
".\n"
"   Joining of new replica should be done completely silently.\n"
"   To do it, we have to do:\n"
"   1) half-unjoin a source replica from the cluster,\n"
"   2) synchronize data from the source replica to the new destination replica,"
"\n"
"   3) join those replicas to the cluster,\n"
"   and 3) wait to dispatch search requests to newly joined replicas until buff"
"ered updating requests are completely processed.)\n"
" * Restart workers after schema change.\n"
"   (Currently, old schema information cached by workers can break indexes for "
"newly added records.)\n"
" * Support various type system notifications.\n"
"   (Currently, munin or something can be available to monitor status of nodes."
"\n"
"   However it should be integrated.)\n"
" * Better compatibility to Groonga: Support `suggest` and related commands.\n"
" * Support various type shardings (e.g. time-range based)."

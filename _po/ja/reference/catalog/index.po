msgid "## How to manage"

msgid ""
"So far, you need to write catalog and share it to all the nodes\n"
"manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some utility programs will generate catalog in near feature.\n"
"Furthermore Droonga network will maintain and share catalog\n"
"automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Glossary"
msgstr ""

msgid "This section describes terms in catalog."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Catalog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Catalog is a series of data which represents the resources in the\n"
"network."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Zone"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Zone is a set of farms. Farms in a zone are expected to close to each\n"
"other, like in the same host, in the same switch, in the same network."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Farm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A farm is a Droonga Engine instance. Droonga Engine is implemented as\n"
"a [Fluentd][] plugin, fluent-plugin-droonga."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A `fluentd` process can have multiple Droonga Engines. If you add one\n"
"or more `match` entries with type `droonga` into `fluentd.conf`, a\n"
"`fluentd` process instantiates one or more Droonga Engines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A farm has its own workers and a job queue. A farm push request to its\n"
"job queue and workers pull a request from the job queue."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Dataset"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dataset is a set of logical tables. A logical table must belong to\n"
"only one dataset."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each dataset must have an unique name in the same Droonga network."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Logical table"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Logical table consists of one or more partitioned physical tables.\n"
"Logical table doesn't have physical records. It returns physical\n"
"records from physical tables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can custom how to partition a logical table into one or more\n"
"physical tables. For example, you can custom partition key, the\n"
"number of partitions and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Physical table"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Physical table is a table in Groonga database. It stores physical\n"
"records of the table."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Ring"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ring is a series of partition sets. Dataset must have one\n"
"ring. Dataset creates logical tables on the ring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Droonga Engine replicates each record in a logical table into one or\n"
"more partition sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Partition set"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Partition set is a set of partitions. A partition set stores all\n"
"records in all logical tables in the same Droonga network. In other\n"
"words, dataset is partitioned in a partition set."
msgstr ""

msgid "A partition set is a replication of other partition set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Droonga Engine may support partitioning in one or more partition\n"
"sets in the future. It will be useful to use different partition\n"
"size for old data and new data. Normally, old data are smaller and\n"
"new data are bigger. It is reasonable that you use larger partition\n"
"size for bigger data."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Partition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Partition is a Groonga database. It has zero or more physical\n"
"tables."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note: Handler plugins in Droonga Engine work on a partition."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Example"
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider about the following case:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" * There are two farms.\n"
" * All farms (Droonga Engine instances) works on the same fluentd.\n"
" * Each farm has two partitions.\n"
" * There are two replicas.\n"
" * There are two partitions for each table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Catalog is written as a JSON file. Its file name is `catalog.json`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a `catalog.json` for the above case:"
msgstr ""

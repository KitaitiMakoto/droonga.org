"In Droonga Engine, there are 2 large pluggable phases and 3 sub phases for plu"

"See the [overview][] to grasp the big picture."

"Adaption phase\n"

"p by step."

msgid "The processing phase includes 3 sub pluggable phases:"

msgid ""
"Handling phase\n"
": At this phase, a plugin can do low-level data handling, for example, databas"

msgid ""
"Planning phase\n"
": At this phase, a plugin can split an incoming request to multiple steps."

msgid ""
"Collection phase\n"
": At this phase, a plugin can merge results from steps to a unified result."

"However, the point of view of these descriptions is based on the design of the"
" system itself, so you're maybe confused.\n"

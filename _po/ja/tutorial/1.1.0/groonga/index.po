msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a data processing engine based on a distributed architecture, named afte"

"As its name suggests, it can work as a Groonga compatible server with some imp"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a certain sense, the Droonga is quite different from Groonga, about its arc"
"hitecture, design, API etc.\n"
"However, you don't have to understand the whole architecture of the Droonga, i"
"f you simply use it just as a Groonga compatible server."

" * Make sure to use instances with >= 2GB memory equipped, at least during ins"

" * Make sure that commands `curl` and `jq` are installed in your computers.\n"

"Second, install the `droonga-http-server`.\n"

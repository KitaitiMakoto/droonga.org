msgstr ""

msgid "Learning steps to prepare multiple (three) virtual machines for experiments."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Why virtual machines?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because Droonga is a distributed data processing system, you have to prepare m"
"ultiple computers to construct a cluster.\n"
"For safety (and good performance) you should use dedicated computers for Droon"
"ga nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need two or more computers for effective replication.\n"
"If you are trying to manage node structure of your cluster effectively, three "
"or more computers are required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, it may cost money that using multiple server instances on virtual pri"
"vate server services, even if you just want to do testing or development.\n"
"So we recommend you to use private virtual machines on your own PC for such ca"
"ses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Luckly, there is a useful software [Vagrant][] to manage virtual machines easi"
"ly.\n"
"This tutorial describes *how to prepare three virtual machines* by Vagrant."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Prepare a host machine"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, you have to prepare a PC as the host of VMs.\n"
"Because each VM requires much RAM, the host machine should have much more RAM "
"- hopefully, 8GB or larger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(However, 3GB RAM may be enough to do experiments.\n"
"When you install components of the Droonga system, the machine must have 2GB R"
"AM at minimum, to build native extensions of [Rroonga][].\n"
"After that, Droonga nodes can work with less RAM, for example 512MB.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "## Steps to prepare VMs"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Install the VirtualBox"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Vagrant requires a backend to run VMs, so you have to install the most rec"
"ommended one: [VirtualBox][].\n"
"For example, if you use an [Ubuntu][] PC, it can be installed via the `apt` co"
"mmand, like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Install the Vagrant"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Go to the [Vagrant web site][Vagrant] and install it as instructed.\n"
"For example, if you use an Ubuntu PC (x64):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n"
"$ wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.6.5_x86_64.deb\n"
"$ sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.6.5_x86_64.deb\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Determine a box and prepare a Vagrantfile"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Go to the [Vagrant Cloud][] and find a box for your experiments.\n"
"For example, if you use a [box for Ubuntu Trusty (x64)](https://vagrantcloud.c"
"om/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64), you just have to do:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ mkdir droonga-ubuntu-trusty\n"
"$ cd droonga-ubuntu-trusty\n"
"$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then a file `Vagrantfile` is automatically generated there.\n"
"However you should rewrite it completely for experiments of Droonga cluster, l"
"ike following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`Vagrantfile`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"n_machines = 3\n"
"box        = \"ubuntu/trusty64\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n"

"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"  end\n"
"end\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note, this `Vagrantfile` defines three VMs with 2GB (2048MB) RAM for each.\n"
"So your host machine must have 6GB or more RAM.\n"
"If your machine has less RAM, set the size to `512` (meaning 512MB) for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Start virtual machines"
msgstr ""

msgid "To start VMs, you just run the command `vagrant up`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ vagrant up\n"
"Bringing machine 'node0' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n"
"Bringing machine 'node1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n"
"Bringing machine 'node2' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n"
"...\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then Vagrant automatically downloads VM image from the [Vagrant Cloud][] web s"
"ite and starts VMs.\n"
"After preparation processes, there are three running VMs with IP address in a "
"virtual private network: `192.168.100.50`, `192.168.100.51`, and `192.168.100."
"52`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's confirm that they are correctly working.\n"
"You can log in those VMs by the command `vagrant ssh`, like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ vagrant ssh node0\n"
"Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-36-generic x86_64)\n"
"...\n"
"vagrant@node0:~$ exit\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Register your VMs to your SSH client"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have to use `vagrant ssh` instead of regular `ssh`, to log in VMs.\n"
"Moreover you have to `cd` before running the command.\n"
"It is annoying a little."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, let's register VMs to your local config file of the SSH client, like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ vagrant ssh-config node0 >> ~/.ssh/config\n"
"$ vagrant ssh-config node1 >> ~/.ssh/config\n"
"$ vagrant ssh-config node2 >> ~/.ssh/config\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After that you can log in to your VMs from the host computer by their name, wi"
"thout `vagrant ssh` command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ ssh node0\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "### Configure your MVs to access each other by their host name"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because there is no name server, each VM cannot resolve host names of others.\n"
"So you have to type their raw IP addresses for now.\n"
"It's very annoying."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, let's modify hosts file on VMs, like:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`/etc/hosts`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"127.0.0.1 localhost\n"
"192.168.100.50 node0\n"
"192.168.100.51 node1\n"
"192.168.100.52 node2\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "After that your VMs can communicate with each other by their host name."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Shutdown VMs"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can shutdown all VMs by the command `vagrant halt`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"~~~\n"
"$ vagrant halt\n"
"~~~"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then Vagrant shuts down all VMs completely."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Appendix: if your host machine has less size RAM..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your host machine has less RAM (for example smaller than 3GB), you cannot r"
"un all VMs with 2GB RAM.\n"
"However, if you configure VMs with small size RAM (ex. 512MB), you cannot inst"
"all Droonga services."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then you can install Droonga services for each VM step by step, like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 1. Shutdown all VMs by `vagrant halt`.\n"
" 2. Open the VirtualBox console by `virtualbox`.\n"
" 3. Go to `properties` of a VM, and enlarge the size of RAM to 2GB (2048MB).\n"
" 4. Start the VM, from the VirtualBox console.\n"
" 5. Log in to the VM and install Droonga services.\n"
" 6. Shutdown the VM.\n"
" 7. Go to `properties` of the VM, and decrease the size of RAM to the original"
" size.\n"
" 8. Repeat steps from 3 to 7 for each VM."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Conclusion"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this tutorial, you did prepare three virtual machines for Droonga nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can try [the \"getting started\" tutorial](../groonga/) and others with mult"
"iple nodes."

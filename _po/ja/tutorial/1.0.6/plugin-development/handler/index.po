msgid ""
" * At the *planning phase*, the Droonga Engine generates multiple sub steps to"
" process the request.\n"
"   In simple cases, you don't have to write codes for this phase, then there i"

" * At the *distribution phase*, the Droonga Engine distributes task messages f"
"or the request, to multiple volumes.\n"
"   (It is completely done by the Droonga Engine itself, so this phase is not p"
"luggable.)\n"
" * At the *handling phase*, *each single volume simply processes only one dist"
"ributed task message as its input, and returns a result.*\n"
"   This is the time that actual storage accesses happen.\n"
"   Actually, some commands (`search`, `add`, `create_table` and so on) access "
"to the storage at the time.\n"
" * At the *collection phase*, the Droonga Engine collects results from volumes"
" to one unified result.\n"
"   There are some useful generic collectors, so you don't have to write codes "
"for this phase in most cases."
msgstr ""
" * *planning phase* では、Droonga Engineはリクエストを処理するための複数のより小さなステップを生成します。\n"
"   単純なコマンドでは、このフェイズのためのコードを書く必要はありません。その場合には、リクエストを処理するためのステップが1つだけ存在するということにな"
"ります。\n"
" * *distribution phase* では、Droonga Engineは、リクエストを処理するためのタスクを表すメッセージを複数のボリュームに配"
"布します。\n"
"   （この処理は完全にDroonga Engine自身によって行われるため、このフェイズはプラグインでの拡張はできません。）\n"
" * *handling phase*では、*各single volumeが、配布された単一のタスクメッセージを入力として処理して、その結果を返します*。\n"
"   ストレージへの読み書きが実際に発生するのは、この時になります。\n"
"   実際に、いくつかのコマンド（例えば `search`、`add`、`create_table` など）はこのタイミングでストレージの読み書きを行ってい"
"ます。\n"
" * *collection phase* では、Droonga Engineが各ボリュームから返された結果を収集して、単一の結果に統合します。\n"

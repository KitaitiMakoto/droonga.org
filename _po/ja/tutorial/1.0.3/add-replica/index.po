msgid "There are two axes, \"replica\" and \"slice\", for Droonga nodes."

"All \"replica\" nodes have completely equal data, so they can process your reque"

"You can increase the capacity of your cluster to process increasing requests, "
"by adding new replicas."

"On the other hand, \"slice\" nodes have different data, for example, one node co"

"You can increase the capacity of your cluster to store increasing data, by add"
"ing new slices."

"Currently, for a Droonga cluster which is configured as a Groonga compatible s"

"We'll improve extensibility for slices in the future."

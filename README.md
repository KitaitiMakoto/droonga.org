# How to translate

See [steps to translate documents at droonga.org](http://droonga.org/community/contribution/i18n/).

Note: Don't edit existing localized versions of "*.md" files directly, because they are automatically generated from locales placed under the "_po" directory.

You can see built pages locally by:

    % bundle install
    % bundle exec jekyll server --watch

And go to: http://localhost:4000/
